      <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
      <p>Success will be measured through an increase in online bookings and enquiries, as well as feedback from patients who visit the site. 
      A reduction in the number of phone enquiries for simple questions (e.g., hours) will also show that the site is effective and easy to use and the customer's could directly message the client.</p>
