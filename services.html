        <h4>How often should I get a dental check-up?</h4>
        <p>Your dental practitioner will recommend a time frame that is appropriate for you based on the state of your oral health. For example, people with very low risk of dental problems may not need to be seen by a dental practitioner as often as a person with complex dental problems. However, it's recommended the time between check-ups is no longer than 2 years.</p>
